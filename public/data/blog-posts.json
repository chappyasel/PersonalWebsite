However, after talking with hundreds of fellow founders, operators, and investors during our weekly <a href=\"https://genaicollective.ai/\">GenAI Collective</a> community events, I have yet to hear a compelling counter to this claim in light of its supporting arguments.</p>\n<p>To get a better sense of where I’m coming from, let me walk you through the seismic shifts I’m seeing playing out in Silicon Valley right now and what happens after the death of early stage venture as we know it.</p>\n<h3>Early Stage Venture 1.0</h3>\n<p>Since the inception of software venture capital in the <a href=\"https://arc.net/l/quote/ixvjaxqp\">1980s</a>, investors have been taking the same fundamental gamble: invest in the 1% of companies with the potential to generate 100x+ returns by reaching a $100M+ run rate and $1B+ valuation, paving the way to an exit via initial public offering (IPO) or large scale M&amp;A. Decades later, startups seeking venture funding face the same implicit requirement to tackle a $1B+ total addressable market (TAM) with a T2D3 (“triple, triple, double, double, double”) growth trajectory.</p>\n<p><strong>In 2024, this standard venture economic model no longer applies.</strong> Why? Underlying every capital allocation is a cost-benefit analysis — and while investors are chasing the same <em>benefit</em> as they were in the 80s, the <em>cost</em> to build software has been dropping precipitously. As generative AI promises to intensify this flame, even Silicon Valley’s most successful (and stubborn) stalwarts won’t be able to neglect this new reality.</p>\n<h3>A New Reality</h3>\n<p>Software companies in the Bronze Age of Silicon Valley faced significant headwinds scaling their businesses. Even as personal computers began to reach commercialization <a href=\"https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter1/the-setting-of-global-transportation-systems/personal-computing-devices/\">in the 1980s</a>, software distribution was <em>entirely physical</em> as the internet didn’t achieve considerable adoption until the <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/internet\">late 1990s</a>. It wasn’t until the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2000/04/20/after-the-gold-rush\">Gold Rush</a> of the Dot-com bubble that low-level programming languages such as Fortran, C, and C++ finally <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qQXXI5QFUfw?feature=shared&amp;t=233\">gave way</a> to high-level, object-oriented languages including Java, Javascript, and eventually Python.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.8vc.com/resources/tech-bubble-or-golden-age\">Golden Age</a> of the past ~20 years has ushered in a series of revolutions in software development and distribution. In mere days and for under $100, founders can now stand up a fully-featured full stack web app on their own domain using a cloud computing service like <a href=\"https://vercel.com/about\">Vercel</a> and get that app in front of thousands of eyeballs using Google AdWords. Oh, and don’t forget that Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are all giving away $100k+ in <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/02/amazon_ai_credits/\">free credits</a>!</p>\n<p>Generative AI is the final piece to this new reality. While Github Copilot promises <a href=\"https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/\">55%</a> efficiency gains, dozens of ambitious startups such as <a href=\"https://www.poolside.ai/\">Poolside</a>, <a href=\"https://magic.dev/\">Magic.dev</a>, <a href=\"https://www.marblism.com/\">Marblism</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cognition-labs.com/\">Cognition</a> promise a transition to fully autonomous coding systems, obviating the need for humans altogether. With over a month of <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chappyasel_how-good-is-cognitions-devin-ai-coding-agent-activity-7175515796842962945-ylpS?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\">hands-on experience</a> using Cognition’s Devin coding agent, I can personally vouch for the efficacy of this new paradigm.</p>\n<p>If we take this observation to its limit, it’s not an <em>if</em> anymore, but <em>when</em> software development becomes fully commoditized. According to my most trusted sources, this happens in the next 2–5 years, if not sooner.</p>\n<h3>We Have No Moat?</h3>\n<p>In this new reality where technical execution ceases to be a competitive moat, how will software companies build products which capture value in the market? What will still matter? I hypothesize that the following two areas will be the difference between success and failure for the next generation of software companies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Product-market fit (PMF)</strong>: achieving alignment between the value a product offers and the demands of the market. The product must also provide differentiated value when compared with alternatives (competitors) and the customer must have a high willingness to pay. You can build all the software in the world, but if you don’t solve a customer’s problem with a high willingness to pay then you’re not going to capture any value.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Go-to-market (GTM)</strong>: designing and executing a plan for sales and distribution that ensures your product reaches your intended audience with the lowest amount of friction and communicates its value effectively. You can build the best software in the world that exactly meets your customer’s every demand, but if you fail to get it into their hands, then you’re not going to capture any value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, you might be saying “sure, sounds reasonable in the short term; however, what about when we have AI built into our phones which can generate apps for us on-the-fly according to our exact preferences? Why will we still need software companies at all?” While that is an intuitive assumption, I’d like to draw an interesting parallel which demonstrates otherwise.</p>\n<h3>The Democratization of Media</h3>\n<p>When broadcast television rose into prominence in the <a href=\"https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~pjs54/Teaching/AutomaticLifestyle-S02/Projects/Vlku/history.html\">1950s</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(American_television)\">“Big Three”</a> dominated the airwaves as cost and complexity created an extraordinarily high barrier to entry. Since then, mobile phones and social media platforms have eroded the barriers to development and distribution, birthing a <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-economy-stats/\">$250B+</a> long tail creator economy — threatening traditional media in the process.</p>\n<p>At over 14 billion views, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XqZsoesa55w\">“Baby Shark Dance”</a> is the single most viewed video of all time. While it is by no means a visual masterpiece, it found product-market fit in a way no piece of traditional media had ever done before.</p>\n<p>Posing a similar question to the above, what happens when media becomes ostensibly free to develop and distribute? Well, that reality is already here. Announced last Wednesday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/udiomusic/status/1778045322654003448\">Udio</a> can generate music indistinguishable from music produced by human artists. This democratization of music will lead to the death of the music industry, right?</p>\n<p>Not so fast. While generative music may take a share of the pie, I’m confident that it will never swallow the whole pie for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice\"><strong>Paradox of choice</strong></a>: An infinite menu of options sounds great until you actually have to pick an option. Curation increases satisfaction.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion\"><strong>Loss aversion</strong></a>: People prefer certain outcomes as opposed to uncertainty, even if strictly rational thinking dictates otherwise.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Laziness</strong>: Prompt engineering requires deep thought and expertise. People want the more convenient option, even if it’s suboptimal.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Human connection</strong>: People crave a shared human connection with the craft which AI can never provide.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is the antidote to all the concerns above? Having someone else create the experience or product for you. People often don’t know what they want until you show it to them. Even in a world where content is free to produce, <strong>people need tastemakers</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Early Stage Venture 2.0</h3>\n<p><strong>As the economics for software change and the </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail\"><strong>long tail</strong></a><strong> opens up, Silicon Valley is experiencing a </strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/micro-saas-what-it-is-and-how-to-build-one\"><strong>micro-SaaS</strong></a><strong> revolution.</strong> Sam Altman is <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/02/04/sam-altman-one-person-unicorn-silicon-valley-founder-myth/\">openly predicting</a> the world’s first single-person unicorn ($1B+ valuation). Anecdotally, I’ve talked with a higher concentration of bootstrapped founders and indie entrepreneurs over the past half year than ever before.</p>\n<p>The early stage venture 1.0 model that has been in operation since the 1980s will fail in this new paradigm where software development is commoditized. Much like traditional media behemoths of the past, the venture landscape is facing a generational reckoning and must adapt in order to survive or risk radical disruption.</p>\n<p>Beyond generating returns, venture has always served the noble purpose of helping founders close the gap between technical feasibility and market adoption. With technological progress accelerating faster than ever before, how does venture continue to fulfill this mission?</p>\n<p>Venture’s solution up until now has been a deepening focus on providing more and more tangible value to founders. Consider the rise of venture incubators which have seen a <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/within-10-years-the-number-of-accelerator-programs-in-the/271000\">10x increase</a> in the preceding decade, or platform funds that provide a rolodex of operators ready to fill the gaps necessary for efficient go-to-market. However, these small changes to the venture model don’t go far enough. Are they really substantively helping startups grow beyond providing a community of experts, GTM seminars, and emotional support? Not really.</p>\n<p>The startup economy needs a first principles rethink. Venture needs to shift to helping the tastemakers of the future solve PMF and GTM at scale — a problem set AI may be farther away from addressing effectively.</p>\n<p>What about the longer term? What happens if or when AI can fully automate PMF and GTM, thereby unlocking infinite scalability? I guess we’ll just have to wait and <a href=\"https://cofactory.ai/\">find out</a>. 😉</p>\n<p><em>Pro tip: you can give up to 50 claps for an article on Medium!

As an AR/VR engineer working on VisionOS for <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chappyasel_after-two-extraordinary-years-yesterday-activity-7120779468511576064-wMEW?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=medium\">the past two years</a> and experiencing firsthand the breathtaking magic that is the VisionOS spatial computing platform, I can say this with the utmost confidence.</p>\n<p>How did we pull this off? What makes Apple so special? How has Apple secured its dominance as the most valuable company, most trusted and admired brand, and most notorious consumer product design house in the world? In my experience working on cross-functional projects with nearly every organization in Apple, there is a particular modus operandi — “the Apple way” — permeating the entire company. Below are four elements of this culture which I believe have been pivotal in elevating Apple to its zenith of innovation and value.</p>\n<h3>Product Ownership</h3>\n<p>The Vision Pro software team has no product managers. Instead, product is a collaborative task shared by the design, engineering, and program management teams. Feature scoping is jointly negotiated, initial designs are handed down, engineering implements and fine tunes, and program management sets guardrails. Throughout the development cycle, the dynamic between these three arms of product is constantly shifting as experimentation crystalizes into implementation.</p>\n<p>Even more unique to Apple is the enigmatic yet eminent Human Interface (HI) design team. Apple is organized functionally, concentrating design under a single roof rather than fracturing based on product category. This is what ensures the inimitable cohesion across all hardware and software that Apple is famous for.</p>\n<p>Earlier, I stated that designs are “handed down.” I say this intentionally to stress the power dynamics between HI and engineering. Design <em>must</em> be on top of engineering. Jointly, design and engineering form a cavalry. Engineering are the workhorses — the agents for realization. While design are the riders, the workhorses ultimately have complete autonomy and final say. Thus, the only way to enforce healthy dialogue is to position design above engineering. Companies which attempt to place engineering and design on equal footing end up with engineering-dominated products once push comes to shove. Need proof? Look at Amazon or Microsoft.</p>\n<h3>Demo Culture</h3>\n<p>The best ideas come from those with the dirtiest hands. Rather than relegating product roadmaps to senior leadership, Apple empowers its cavalry of over 20,000 to define its future. Apple is famous for its demo culture, and particularly as an individual contributor, prototypes are a potent conduit for action. Ultimately, the best idea demonstrated well wins out.</p>\n<p>The software engineering organization (SWE) hosts annual week-long hackathons with thousands of internal participants. Each year, top projects are selected and demoed directly to company executives — the best of which get scoped out and productized. This is the magic of Apple’s demo culture, institutionalized.</p>\n<h3>Secrecy</h3>\n<p><em>“Are you disclosed?”</em> Apple is just as secretive internally as it is externally. Even within Apple, unreleased projects are kept on a strictly need-to-know basis. While I worked directly on the the Vision Pro software and hardware platform for two years, many of its core features — even down to the product and OS names themselves — remained a mystery until its public unveiling at WWDC 2023.</p>\n<p>While intra-company secrecy risks misalignment and duplicated efforts — when properly habituated and enforced — its benefits far outweigh the costs. Great care is taken to keep everything Apple does for <em>the right</em> internal eyes only. A key point of pride and ultimately cultural identity, this cultist mantra extends from within the company to without and has led to the world’s strongest and most admired brand image. Few companies can claim to have <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/\">entire</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/\">news</a> <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/\">outlets</a> dedicated to tracking their every move.</p>\n<h3>User Obsession</h3>\n<p>Wagering an outsider’s guess, the Vision Pro product category will not turn a profit for Apple this decade. With billions of dollars spent in research and development and a niche initial market, the climb to profitability will be a slow one. What allows Apple to operate on time horizons matched by no other company is their single profit and loss center model.</p>\n<p>During my two years at Apple, profitability was never mentioned. Not even once. Instead, our focus was on entirely on creating a wholly uncompromising user experience. Contrast this approach with the rest of Silicon Valley which is manically metrics-driven. When I worked at <a href=\"https://www.li.me/\">Lime</a>, one of the <a href=\"https://www.atommobility.com/blog/bird-vs-lime-vs-helbiz\">fastest companies ever</a> to achieve unicorn status, a quantifiable business case had to made for each and every change. Want to redesign a user interface? Design an A/B test and prove that the redesign leads to objectively higher engagement or retention. Any change not meeting this bar is a waste of company time and money.</p>\n<p>Apple’s shared P&amp;L center has innumerable advantages for the end user. This includes a nearly infinite attention to detail, a compulsion to place privacy and security first, and a genuine focus on sustainability. And, ultimately, it frees teams at Apple to build the very best products and experiences in the world.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: The opinions presented here are all based on my experience and do not necessarily reflect how Apple operates.

They are unanimously calling attention to the profound social, cultural, and even cosmic implications foreshadowed by the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). The line between creator and creation is blurring — challenging the very notion of what it means to be human. More existentially, many claim we are living on the precipice of life’s most significant evolution in its 3.7-billion-year history¹.</p>\n<p>As anyone living in <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/technology/what-is-cerebral-valley-san-franciscos-nerdiest-new-neighborhood/\">Cerebral Valley</a> will tell you, AI is the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/cerebral-valley-ai-summit\">new land of opportunity</a>. While Google Research <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html\">kicked off the gold rush</a> in 2017, it was OpenAI that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/technology/chatgpt-ai-twitter.html\">roused mass awareness</a> when it <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\">released ChatGPT</a> to the public last November². Announced merely four months later, its successor, <a href=\"https://openai.com/gpt-4\">GPT-4</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/gpt-4\">surpasses human performance</a> on a majority of standardized tests and is too powerful for full public release³.</p>\n<p>With this blistering pace of progress, are we on the verge of some grand, culminating crescendo? Will the rate of technological advancement continue its exponential increase to near infinity? Or are we instead in the midst of a <a href=\"https://thehistoryofcomputing.net/ai-hype-cycles-and-winters-on-the-way-to-chatgpt\">seventh AI hype cycle</a>, with progress doomed to tail off logarithmically?</p>\n<p>In a quest to demystify the exciting world of artificial general intelligence (AGI), this four-part manifesto answers this question among many others. It is a concise yet comprehensive map, generously dotted with links and footnotes inviting deeper self-exploration (this first part alone has over a hundred). In this journey, I am as much an explorer as you are. Consider this not as the final word, but as the sowing of seeds for much-needed dialogue and debate on AGI and our shared future.</p>\n<p>We will begin by defining AGI and its related terminology, in the process presenting the grand promise that AGI presents. “Part II: Prediction” will assuage realists’ concerns by investigating possible fallacies and laying out practical timelines for our path to AGI according to the latest insights from world experts. “Part III: Perils” will examine the myriad existential threats brought forth by alarmists standing between us and AGI. Finally, armed with this full array of perspectives, “Part IV: Progress” will present pragmatic advice for grasping the near-term implications and structuring our individual lives in light of this understanding. Let us embark on this thrilling adventure together.</p>\n<h3>What is AGI?</h3>\n<p>Often overlooked is the fact that OpenAI — the biggest name in the AI game — has the <a href=\"https://openai.com/about\">stated mission</a> to “ensure that artificial general intelligence — AI systems that are generally smarter than humans — benefits all of humanity.” Google DeepMind’s <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/about\">long-term goal</a> is to “solve intelligence, developing more general and capable problem-solving systems, known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).” This begs the question: what is AGI and why is achieving it a central goal for titans of the AI industry?</p>\n<p>Put simply, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence\">AGI</a>⁴ is a computer program that surpasses human performance in almost all intellectual tasks⁵. Obviously, creating an intelligence greater than ourselves will have extraordinary implications, promising to revolutionize every conceivable facet of our lives⁶. However, one does not need to look that far ahead — the fruits of this future are already ripening. <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html\">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights\">McKinsey</a> estimates agree that the recent boom in generative AI alone could nearly double rates of worldwide GDP growth and birth a <a href=\"https://finbold.com/ai-sector-to-become-a-trillion-dollar-market-in-the-next-5-years/\">trillion-dollar industry</a>. Still, these projections could be wildly conservative if advancements maintain their current clip. So, how do we get from where we are to humanity-altering AGI?</p>\n<h3>Accelerating Change</h3>\n<p>Superficially, creating an AI system more capable than ourselves presents an imposing challenge. However, underlying the incredible surge in complexity and capability of AI models in recent years is a simple yet powerful concept: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change\">accelerating rate of technological change</a>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YGAmrSFGBt7uL2Qo9PNJVQ.png\"></figure><p>Perhaps the most famous quantifiable example of this is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\">Moore’s law</a>. <a href=\"https://sciencehistory.org/education/scientific-biographies/gordon-e-moore/\">Gordon Moore</a> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190327213847/https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/moores-law-electronics.pdf\">posited in 1965</a> that the number of transistors on computer chips doubles every three years — an observation which has proven true for <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png\">over 120 years</a> now. Plenty more examples of this exponential rate of return also exist. Global data is <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/\">doubling every three years</a>. Supercomputers are doubling in computational power <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Estimations_of_Human_Brain_Emulation_Required_Performance.svg\">every 1.2 years</a>. Lighting is <a href=\"https://fee.org/articles/lighting-is-500-000-times-cheaper-today/\">1,898 times cheaper</a> now than it was in 1900⁷.</p>\n<p>Exponential change is not just an abstract concept, either — it plays into our everyday lives. The move from hunter-gatherer societies to agriculture took <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-the-first-farmers-arrived-in-europe-inequality-evolved/\">thousands of years</a>. The transition from closed autocracies to majority adoption of electoral-based governmental systems took <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/democracy\">174 years</a>. Electricity took <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/11/the-pace-of-technology-adoption-is-speeding-up\">twenty years</a> to accomplish that same mark. The internet did so in <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/rising-speed-technological-adoption/\">just over ten years</a>. Smartphones needed only <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/rising-speed-technological-adoption/\">five years</a>. ChatGPT, released mere months ago, is now used by <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/24/a-majority-of-americans-have-heard-of-chatgpt-but-few-have-tried-it-themselves/\">over 14% of Americans</a>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*R46z0-vezA-kfGA1Jic_qA.png\"></figure><p>There is a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events.svg\">broad consensus among experts</a> that paradigm shifts are occurring faster than ever. OpenAI CEO <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-ceo-career-net-worth-ycombinator-prepper-2023-1\">Sam Altman</a>’s <a href=\"https://moores.samaltman.com/\">“Moore’s Law for Everything”</a> goes so far as to imagine a future of abundance where everything, from education to clothing, follows exponential progress. Are AI systems bound to track this same trajectory, with intelligence exploding exponentially?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_scaling_law\">Neural scaling laws</a> suppose that factors such as <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/artificial-intelligence-training-computation\">computational power</a>, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/artificial-intelligence-parameter-count\">parameter count</a>, and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/artificial-intelligence-number-training-datapoints\">dataset size</a> all correlate with model performance and thus intelligence. Analyses from <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/gpt-4\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/scaling-laws-for-ai-and-some-implications\">independent research</a> show promising and persisting positive relationships⁸. What’s even more impressive are studies pointing to larger AI models exhibiting <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682\">emergent abilities</a> and the formation of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00612\">complex internal representations</a>. Thus, AI seems poised to ride on the coattails of <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/ai-anthropic-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-b2282110.html\">compounding exponential curves</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Singularity</h3>\n<p>Let’s assume that everything goes to plan, intelligence continues to scale with technological progress, and we successfully develop AGI. What happens when machine sapience eclipses human sentience?</p>\n<blockquote>“Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an “intelligence explosion,” and the intelligence of man would be left far behind…. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.”</blockquote>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-artificial-intelligence-surpass-our-own/\"><em>~ I.J. Good (1965)</em></a></blockquote>\n<p>This intelligence explosion is often referred to as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\">technological singularity</a>: a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. Many of mankind’s greatest minds <a href=\"https://www.singularityweblog.com/17-definitions-of-the-technological-singularity/\">have theorized</a> about this event — rightfully so as it is difficult to overstate the cosmically monumental nature of this moment.</p>\n<p>This is not merely another mile marker in the inexorable march of technological progress but a unique, singular moment where a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120805130100/singularity.org/files/GISAI.html\">“seed AI”</a> capable of recursive self-improvement ushers in a new era of intelligent, non-biological life. <a href=\"https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/\">Max Tegmark</a> describes the nature of this transition well in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598\"><em>Life 3.0</em></a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Life 1.0: life that <em>evolves</em> its hardware and software, biological stage.</li>\n<li>Life 2.0: life that <em>evolves</em> its hardware but <em>designs</em> much of its software, cultural stage.</li>\n<li>Life 3.0: life that <em>designs</em> its hardware and software, technological stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“All the change in the last million years will be superseded by the change in the next five minutes.”</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<em>~ </em><a href=\"https://www.veneermagazine.com/01-18/01/the_group/singularity.html\"><em>Kevin Kelley</em></a>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Promise</h3>\n<p>What happens once we reach the technological singularity? In his book, Tegmark details <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/ai/ai-aftermath-scenarios/\">twelve possible scenarios</a>, ranging from idyllic utopias where humans and AI live together harmoniously, to speculative futures governed by AI, to ominous outcomes where AI replaces humanity altogether⁹. Regardless of outcome, it is clear that the fate of the human race hangs in the balance. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy\">Tim Urban</a> illustrates the dichotomous nature of the singularity well in <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html\">“The AI Revolution: Our Immortality or Extinction”</a>:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A7r_OPLYhszHn-nfAROn4w.jpeg\"></figure><p>Those who herald the singularity’s utopian promise and take deliberate action to hasten its realization are commonly referred to as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularitarianism\">Singularitarians</a>. From a philosophical standpoint, this movement along with its siblings, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism\">Transhumanism</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extropianism\">Extropianism</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataism#:~:text=Dataism%20is%20a%20term%20that,New%20York%20Times%20in%202013.\">Dataism</a>, draw surprising parallels to traditional religion. Quoting from my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qdvXY3rX5ZbEZBWWxgOifFJ1YDYMgzNx-CCzxorQuEs/\">book summary</a> of devout Singularitarian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil\">Ray Kurzweil</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Singularity-Near-Humans-Transcend-Biology/dp/0143037889\"><em>The Singularity is Near</em></a>, the transcendent overtones are readily apparent:</p>\n<blockquote>The purpose of life and evolution is to reverse entropy and move towards ever greater order, complexity, elegance, knowledge, intelligence, beauty, etc. The universe is just a belief (not fact) since our consciousness is subjective experience. Thus, this continued drive is akin to religious divine creation in reverse: the universe will “wake up” as it becomes one conscious intelligence and seeks to understand itself.</blockquote>\n<p>According to philosophers such as <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/\">Plato</a>, <a href=\"http://socialsciences.in/article/rene-descartes%E2%80%99-rationalizing-religion\">René Descartes</a>, and <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/\">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, religion endows us with a set of shared values, cosmic significance, immortality of the soul, and faith in a superhuman order. Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.ynharari.com/\">Yuval Harari</a> notes in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095\"><em>Sapiens</em></a> that religions are universal and missionary, seeking global belief in the same imagined order. In this context, the technological singularity can be perceived as a form of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-consciousness-conundrum\">religious doctrine</a>: a quasi-spiritual event bringing with it universal eternal life and god-like power through technological means.</p>\n<p>Importantly, these two viewpoints are <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/persons-of-interest/faith-science-and-francis-collins\">not mutually exclusive</a>; the singularity can be both a religious and scientific concept simultaneously. In fact, <em>Sapiens</em> points out that governments operate in much the same way: a strong shared belief in a higher order allows for cooperation on unprecedented scales. In fact, this may even be the critical development that allowed <a href=\"https://evolutionnews.org/2021/07/reviewing-sapiens-getting-the-origin-of-religion-backwards/#Missing_Data_Points:~:text=previous%20post.-,Missing%20Data%20Points,-As%20I%20noted\">complex, large-scale societies to flourish</a> in the first place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/openai-altman-artificial-intelligence-regulation.html\">Testifying before the US Senate judiciary committee in May</a>, CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/ai-religion/\">said that</a> OpenAI “was founded on the belief that artificial intelligence has the ability to improve nearly every aspect of our lives.” That’s exactly what the technological singularity is: a faith in a new form of intelligence transforming humanity for the better. The singularity is by no means a foregone conclusion; yet, in an era of ever-increasing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/opinion/narcissism-is-increasing-so-youre-not-so-special.html\">narcissism</a> and <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/505745/depression-rates-reach-new-highs.aspx\">purposelessness</a>, this belief may just be the digital-age religion that our <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/how-u-s-religious-composition-has-changed-in-recent-decades/\">increasingly secular world</a> is in desperate search of¹⁰.</p>\n<h3>Looking Forward</h3>\n<p>Clearly, there is a reason that the world’s eminent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html\">researchers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDy7s1SDDn4\">entrepreneurs</a>, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2023/06/06/ai-will-save-the-world/\">investors</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pkedrosky/status/1653955254181068801?s=20\">public figures</a> are universally bringing attention to the recent advancements in AI. This is not just another ripple in the waves of progress but a spectacularly monumental shift in the fabric of existence itself. The technological singularity promises a new era of unimaginable potential where intelligence accelerates past biological capability, birthing a future where the boundaries between humanity and technology blur — challenging our perception of what it means to be human and even our very understanding of the universe.</p>\n<p>Our depiction of progress in AI up until now has been entirely positive and permeated with a sense of techno-utopian optimism. Of course, many significant hurdles lie between where we stand and the development of AGI. The technological singularity is not a foregone conclusion but a hopeful future that the AI community is faithfully navigating toward. In part II, we will examine the latest opinions from world experts to identify possible oversights in the claims above any lay out practical timelines for our path to AGI.</p>\n<p>As we look forward, the promise of AGI should serve as a beacon of optimism — guiding us through the complexities and challenges — lighting the path to a future where the fusion of humanity and technology ushers in a new era of enlightenment.</p>\n<p>[<strong>1</strong>] There is some debate as to the age of life on Earth. Estimates range from 3.4 billion to 4.3 billion years ago, depending on your definition of life and unconfirmed evidence. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_known_life_forms\">Read more here</a>.</p>\n<p>[<strong>2</strong>] Of course, much happened between Google Research’s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">Transformer paper</a> in 2017 and ChatGPT in late 2022. In 2020, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NPCollapse\">Connor Leahy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrV19SjKUss&amp;t=175s&amp;ab_channel=MachineLearningStreetTalk\">said OpenAI’s GPT-3</a> is “as intelligent as a human.” In May of 2022, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/datadecisionmakers/is-deepminds-gato-the-worlds-first-agi/\">DeepMind introduced Gato</a>, the world’s first multimodal generalist agent. For a full overview, I highly recommend reading through <a href=\"https://lifearchitect.ai/about-alan/\">Alan Thompson</a>’s list of milestones in <a href=\"https://lifearchitect.ai/agi/\">“Alan’s conservative countdown to AGI.”</a></p>\n<p>[<strong>3</strong>] OpenAI has famously disclosed very little about GPT-4, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview\">sparking fierce debate</a>. Furthermore, its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdhZwyf24mE&amp;ab_channel=CNETHighlights\">much touted multimodality</a> is still not available to the public. Meta’s chief AI scientist, <a href=\"https://research.facebook.com/people/lecun-yann/\">Yann LeCun</a>, is an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/technology/ai-meta-open-source.html\">outspoken proponent</a> of open research; yet even their most recent model, <a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/voicebox-generative-ai-model-speech/\">Voicebox</a>, was not made available to the public due to “potential risks of misuse.”</p>\n<p>[<strong>4</strong>] Breaking down artificial general intelligence (AGI) from a first principles standpoint can be helpful. <a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/artificial\">Artificial</a>: made by people, often as a copy of something natural. <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/general\">General</a>: not confined by specialization or careful limitation. <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/intelligence\">Intelligence</a>: capacity for learning, reasoning, understanding, and similar forms of mental activity.</p>\n<p>[<strong>5</strong>] In practice, however, AGI is an imprecise term with <a href=\"http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Artificial_General_Intelligence\">many related definitions</a>. Related to AGI is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence\">superintelligence</a> (ASI). <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/\">Nick Bostrom</a>, synonymous with the term after his <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742\">seminal book</a> bearing the same name, <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligence\">defines it as</a> “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field.” One could argue that these terms read quite similarly; however, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/fqczxb/comment/flr82kq\">this Reddit comment</a> describes the difference eloquently: “AGI would be like a machine that can match peak human mobility. It can walk 3mph, sprint at 26mph, run a marathon at 13mph. ASI is when we invent machines that can travel at mach 10, can fly, can swim at a 100mph, can go thousands of miles without stopping.” For the sake of <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F02sqk3,Artificial%20super%20intelligence,%2Fm%2F0f5kk,Superintelligence&amp;hl=en\">relevancy</a> and simplicity, I will use “AGI” interchangeably with both superintelligence and the technological singularity to refer to the point where an AI model far more capable than all humans is created and an explosion of recursive self-improvement begins.</p>\n<p>[<strong>6</strong>] <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nearcyan/status/1639029957702590464\">Some experts claim</a> that we have already achieved an early form of AGI.

GPT-4 now surpasses the average human in the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/\">majority of standardized tests</a>, including achieving an <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/i-gave-chatgpt-an-iq-test-heres-what-i-discovered/\">IQ score of 155</a>.

In fact, many of <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/ai/ai-aftermath-scenarios/\">Max Tegmark’s twelve scenarios</a> have been depicted in popular media. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film)\"><em>Her</em></a> (descendants scenario), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)\"><em>The Matrix</em></a> series (zookeeper, conquers), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas_(Black_Mirror)\"><em>Black Mirror: White Christmas</em></a> (enslaved god), and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E\"><em>WALL-E</em></a> (benevolent dictator) are my favorites. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four\"><em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em></a> (1984 scenario) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World\"><em>Brave New World</em></a> (benevolent dictator) are classic novels which loosely explore the topic. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Look_Up\"><em>Don’t Look Up</em></a> is another film which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1642026231766953985?lang=en\">also strikes home</a> (pun intended). Is it worth taking time to seriously ponder what comes after the singularity? Personally, I subscribe to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge\">Vernor Vinge</a>’s <a href=\"https://mindstalk.net/vinge/vinge-sing.html\">original analogy</a> — the technological singularity has an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon\">event horizon</a> by which all subsequent events are unforeseeable.</p>\n<p>[<strong>10</strong>] Let me couch this claim by pointing out that this concept of AI forming the basis for a new religion is <em>quite</em> a rabbit hole. <a href=\"https://anthonylevandowski.com/\">Anthony Levandowski</a>, co-founder of self-driving car company <a href=\"https://waymo.com/\">Waymo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/anthony-levandowski-artificial-intelligence-religion/\">founded the “Way of the Future” church in 2015</a> focused on “the realization, acceptance, and worship of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed through computer hardware and software.” After serving an 18-month prison sentence, Levandowski <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/anthony-levandowski-closes-his-church-of-ai/\">shuttered the church’s doors</a> in 2021. Religion is having <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/16/opinion/ai-ethics-religion.html\">an effect on AI as well</a>. Founded in 2017, <a href=\"https://aiandfaith.org/\">AI and Faith</a> is an interfaith coalition that encourages religious discussion around the moral and ethical challenges of AI. In 2020, technology firms <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-03-03/can-religion-save-us-from-artificial-inte\">such as Microsoft</a> signed the <a href=\"https://www.romecall.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RomeCall_Paper_web.pdf\">Rome Call for AI Ethics</a> which was created by the Vatican to vouch for more transparent, inclusive, and impartial AI systems.</p>\n<p><em>Pro tip: you can give up to 50 claps for an article on Medium!

Can public policy keep pace with the rapid developments in AI? How will generative AI transform the creator economy? How can startups working with generative AI develop competitive moats? How do we invest in and capitalize on the generative AI boom? These were just a few of the thought provoking questions discussed at the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7047307632394567680\">SF GAI Summit</a>.</p>\n<p>We are living in an exciting period of accelerating technical progress that is actively reshaping our economic and societal landscapes. We can all feel the tectonic plates shifting under our feet and are trying to <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.275.5306.1616\">predict the future’s tremors</a>. This collective curiosity manifested at the summit as animated conversation between inquisitive minds swirled throughout the room, reminiscent of a modern <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club\">Homebrew Club</a> — fertile ground for the mushrooming of generative AI’s next great innovations, products, and companies.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Nf9qhRM3o5wIV6W1\"></figure><h3>Discovering Generative AI</h3>\n<p>I distinctly remember the spark of awe and curiosity that struck me when <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165\">GPT-3 was announced</a> in May of 2020. Books like Max Tegmark’s <em>Life 3.0</em> and Ray Kurzweil’s <em>The Singularity is Near</em>,<em> </em>which provide glimpses into the future of AI and technological development, hinted that GPT-3 was a significant step towards AGI and the beginning of an important shift in the perception of the capabilities of AI.</p>\n<p>I was obsessed. Whenever someone was kind enough to lend me an ear, I would inevitably talk it right off with musings of this transformational technology and its profound implications on our future. My friends and I frequently found ourselves entrapped in passionate discussion surrounding AI theory late into the night.</p>\n<p>Generative AI’s “<a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2015/the-netscape-moment-20-years-on/\">Netscape moment</a>” was the public release of ChatGPT in November of 2022. The technology hit mainstream consciousness seemingly overnight after stories by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/technology/chatgpt-ai-twitter.html\">New York Times</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/tech-news-briefing/what-is-chatgpt-the-ai-chatbot-that-everyone-is-talking-about/52dc7d29-13cd-4be2-85ae-ac958004239f\">Wall Street Journal</a>, and many others. Soon after, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-generative-ai-san-francisco-hayes-silicon-cerebral-valley-2023-1\">Hayes Valley emerged</a> as a mecca for generative AI development. With this blossoming of collective curiosity, we began looking for ways to broaden our living room discussions to include others sharing our same interest and enthusiasm for generative AI.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*jPq-VM_INp2DMxj_\"></figure><h3>A Shared Curiosity</h3>\n<p>Inspired by other creative gatherings such as the infamous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club\">Homebrew Club</a>, Nick Gray’s <em>The 2-Hour Cocktail Party</em>, and eager for a venue to push past the lack of structure and substance frequent at traditional networking events, we planned a meetup centered around thoughtful and engaging group discussion. Invigorated, we began reaching out to like-minded people who shared our fascination with generative AI.</p>\n<p>On a Monday night in early February, a dozen of us gathered in Stephen’s cozy San Francisco apartment. Circled around a table, we spent the entire evening engaged in a lively series of discussions including how we were using ChatGPT, how to build startups, and the incredible potential of AGI. Excitement filled the air as everyone relished the opportunity to meet, discuss, and learn collectively.</p>\n<p>Reflecting together after, we had no doubt that a special energy had been captured. It was clear to everyone that this was not simply a collection of individuals; rather, this was the seed of a community with a collective fascination in generative AI eager to learn, grow, and build together.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*pCTE-XbDrMLqC4SQ\"></figure><h3>Intentionality and Intimacy</h3>\n<p>Cornerstone to our early events was fostering a sense of community through being intentional about the events’ structure — centering each evening on intimate group discussion. We aspire for everyone to depart with a network of close new connections, convinced that by rubbing shoulders with the brightest minds in generative AI, they are not only enriching their own understanding but making their own tangible impact on the discussion and the field as a whole.</p>\n<p>To create a nurturing communal environment, we helped guide group discussion through a round of introductions and friendly icebreakers followed with thoughtful open-ended conversation focused on everyone’s most pressing questions. To our shared delight, every single member from the first event made it to the second one a few weeks later!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*jZAdw_ujQOjIfgBt\"></figure><h3>The GenAI Collective</h3>\n<p>The GenAI Collective began to grow organically into a community of founders, funders, and thought leaders built around a shared curiosity for generative AI. Each event kicked off enlightening discussion around the current and future of generative AI which continued online as we honed in on how to best manifest our community’s shared values.</p>\n<p>Interest picked up rapidly as the third “living room discussion” meetup received over 250 RSVPs. Realizing that the GenAI Collective had outgrown Stephen’s cozy apartment, we were eager to find a new forum where everyone could join in sharing the community’s collective curiosity. Committed to the GenAI Collective’s core values of intentionality and intimacy, we envisioned a new large-scale event format staying true to the structure that everyone had grown to love so much.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HDoSMz4yxm07zWA0\"></figure><h3>Scaling the Summit</h3>\n<p>Recruiting a network of a dozen outstanding volunteers from previous meetups and armed with a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/chappyasel/cac568706875e73ecd1f6f6d6fd7db7f\">custom Python script</a> to generate group assignments, all that remained was to find a venue. Ever since our first visit to Werqwise during TechCrunch Disrupt, we knew that its inviting atmosphere would make for a perfect new home. Joining in a frenzied effort to rearrange Werqwise’s homey furniture to accommodate nine discussion groups, we began welcoming members just in time at 6:30pm.</p>\n<p>The venue filled up quickly as over 150 of the brightest minds in generative AI assembled, celebrating a milestone moment for the community. Reflecting on the GenAI Collective’s first large event, a few key insights emerge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facing a technological landscape evolving so quickly, we are all novices. As novices, the best thing we can do is exercise our personal curiosity and learn together.</li>\n<li>Learning is most effective through thoughtful and welcoming discussion in an environment full of diverse perspectives. Seek think tanks, not echo chambers.</li>\n<li>Discussion is great, but community takes learning a step further. Engage, forge new connections, follow up, and grow collectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*6ZPsviMwKp35XZwO\"></figure><h3>A Growing Community</h3>\n<p>From its humble beginnings as an intimate gathering in Stephen’s cozy San Francisco apartment, the GenAI Collective has flourished into a vibrant community uniting the brightest minds in generative AI. Every member who has shared their insights, experiences, and enthusiasm has helped elevate the GenAI Collective into a powerful nexus for discussion, collaboration, and innovation.</p>\n<p>These are the seeds of a modern <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club\">Homebrew Club</a> where great minds gather around a shared curiosity. A <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/\">Future of Life Institute</a> open to all where collective action occurs. Where opportunity is explored. Where novel ideas incubate. Where friendships and partnerships blossom. The field of generative AI will continue to evolve but our communal mission will remain unwavering. We eagerly anticipate the incredible achievements this community will continue to make in shaping the future of generative AI!</p>\n<p>To all those reading: you are joining this community at the ground floor of something great. Stephen, Pierce, and I eagerly anticipate writing the next chapter in the GenAI Collective’s remarkable story together with you. We encourage you to join this exciting community in person by attending an upcoming event or virtually through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gaicollective\">social media</a>!</p>\n<p><em>Pro tip: you can give up to 50 claps for an article on Medium!

Sometimes a decade happens in a month.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\">ChatGPT</a> has taken the world by storm heralding the prospects and perils of generative artificial intelligence to a mass audience for the first time. ChatGPT reached one million users in five days, fifteen times faster than any prior app, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/\">now over 100 million</a> have experienced the weird and wonderous musings of generative AI.</p>\n<p>The frenetic pace of development accelerated this month as OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with the release of <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/gpt-4\">GPT-4</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins\">ChatGPT Plugins</a>. Google announced <a href=\"https://bard.google.com/\">Bard</a>, their <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/03/announcing-palm-api-and-makersuite.html\">PaLM API</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-is-shoving-generative-ai-into-gmail-docs-sheets-meet-chat-and-slides-161711903.html\">integration with Google Workspaces</a>. Microsoft announced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7xTBa93TX8\">integration of generative AI</a> into many of its existing products, including a new release of <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/new\">Bing Chat</a> to all users. A plethora of startups such as <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\">Anthropic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/\">Midjourney</a> and <a href=\"https://runwayml.com/\">Runway ML</a> have rushed their latest models to market. Open-source models such as <a href=\"https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html\">Stanford’s Alpaca</a>, <a href=\"https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/03/24/hello-dolly-democratizing-magic-chatgpt-open-models.html\">Databrick’s Dolly</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.net/blog/cerebras-gpt-a-family-of-open-compute-efficient-large-language-models/\">Cerebras’ GPTs</a> are quickly proliferating the market. The progression of images by Midjourney in the following graphic illustrates the astounding speed with which generative AI systems are progressing.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A comparison of Midjourney models by version, from V1 in March 2022 to V5 in March 2023.

Highlighting the significance of the GPT-3 upgrade, Microsoft Research claims GPT-4 shows ‘<a href=\"https://futurism.com/gpt-4-sparks-of-agi\">sparks of artificial general intelligence</a>.’ A report by Goldman Sachs this week predicts that generative AI could <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/generative-ai-could-impact-300m-jobs-goldman-sachs-predicts/#:~:text=The%20technology%2C%20which%20can%20create%20new%20material%20on,in%20the%20next%2010%20years%2C%20the%20report%20said.\">impact 300 million jobs</a> by replacing up to 50% of their workload and increasing GDP by up to 7% in the next ten years.</p>\n<p>Yet <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\">The Future of Life Institute published an open letter</a> this week signed by over 2,000 AI luminaries calling for an immediate six-month moratorium on training giant AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. Chatbots have aroused political ire with claims of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/24/woke-ai-chatgpt-culture-war/\">“woke AI” from right-wing activists</a> while schools have scrambled to enact policies for <a href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/2023/1/6/23543039/chatgpt-school-districts-ban-block-artificial-intelligence-open-ai#:~:text=School%20districts%20in%20Los%20Angeles%20and%20Baltimore%20have,benefits%20and%20risks%20that%20accompany%20the%20new%20technology.\">student use of chatbots</a> in homework assignments. The Supreme Court has heard arguments in <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/the-supreme-court-case-that-could-fundamentally-change-the-internet/ar-AA17StrY\"><em>Gonzales v. Google</em></a> that could fundamentally alter the Internet by making online sites liable for content they host. Google’s hurried introduction of Bard <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\">cost the company $100 billion</a> in market value when it shared inaccurate information in a promotional video. “This is going to be the <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/the-right-s-new-culture-war-target-woke-ai/ar-AA17SYKI\">content moderation wars on steroids</a>,” observed Stanford law professor Evelyn Donek, an expert in online speech.</p>\n<h3><strong><em>A Misguided AI Moratorium</em></strong></h3>\n<p>While consternation is understandable, calls for a moratorium are misguided. Instead, generative AI efforts must <strong><em>accelerate</em></strong> development to fix premature versions of models that are already widely available. An effective response will require a coordinated public and private effort to augment and rein in early generative AI releases and the data infrastructure on which they are built.</p>\n<p>The call for a moratorium mirrors public responses to paradigm shifts over centuries. Copernican heliocentrism unleashed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Inquisition\">Roman Inquisition</a> in the sixteenth century. Church elders initially opposed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89647443-29c7-421f-86aa-5a12af6268c0\">Ben Franklin’s seemingly innocuous lightning rod</a> fearing it was interfering with the ‘artillery of heaven.’ New media channels from radio to television to social media have aroused calls for bans. The recent <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/attention-is-all-you-need-gets-no-attention-at-all/\">Supreme Court debate over Section 230</a> of the 1996 Communications Decency Act illustrate well founded caution about how technology impacts media, current events and public discourse. As Thomas Kuhn observed in <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>, vehement opposition is often a sign that a paradigmatic shift is underway.</p>\n<p>Future of Life Institute president and MIT professor Max Tegmark is a prescient scholar on artificial intelligence. Shortly after Google published its seminal <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">“Attention is all you need”</a> research paper, Tegmark described a scenario eerily like ChatGPT in <em>Life 3.0 </em>to illustrate the public policy challenges raised by the prospect of artificial general intelligence (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence\">AGI</a>). <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/science/bill-gates-is-worried-about-artificial-intelligence-too/#:~:text=Bill%20Gates%20has%20a%20warning%20for%20humanity%3A%20Beware,threat%20from%20machines%20that%20can%20think%20for%20themselves.\">Joining a long list of technology literati</a> who have highlighted the risks of intelligence computing, Tegmark called for government to adopt early public policy measures to harness the potential of AGI while mitigating dystopian downside risks. His early warning unheeded, Tegmark has reminded us that the risks of fake media, echo chambers, and misinformation observed on the Internet may be perniciously magnified with generative AI.</p>\n<p>As a signatory to the Future of Life letter, Elon Musk appreciates how damaging premature releases of consequential technology can be. Tesla Autopilot precipitated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/15/tesla-us-car-carashes-driver-assist-systems\">273 reported accidents in 2021</a>, more than any other automaker using autonomous driving technology. Yet Musk’s call for a moratorium on the development of AI seems disingenuous as Tesla continues to market Autopilot despite its sketchy track record.</p>\n<p>Yet there are at least three reasons to oppose a moratorium on generative AI.</p>\n<p>First, the letter is a call for inaction without a prescription for action. The letter does not explain what should be done by whom during a six month cease fire and suggests the moratorium could well extend beyond six months. If the moratorium is extended, the letter offers no guideposts to indicate when activities may safely resume. We risk entering a cave from which we may never emerge.</p>\n<p>Second, cease fires are rarely uniformly observed. There are too many open-source generative AI models available to effectively monitor a moratorium. While we may agree that the large language models were prematurely released, a moratorium keeps faulty versions in the wild. A cease fire may be honored by the white hats but ignored by the black hats.</p>\n<p>Third, the rushed release of new machine learning models has unleashed an arms race among competing countries as well as rival firms. The global race for AI leadership is too important for the U.S. to adopt a unilateral cease fire. Vladimir Putin has said whoever leads in AI would “<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/01/17/whoever-leads-in-artificial-intelligence-in-2030-will-rule-the-world-until-2100/\">rule the world</a>.” The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been called the first war with <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/cyber-war-and-ukraine#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20preliminary%20review%20of%20cyber%20operations,the%20first%20major%20conflict%20involving%20large-scale%20cyber%20operations.\">large scale cyber operations</a>. Xi Jingping has publicly vowed that <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-06/china-plans-to-become-ai-world-leader/10332614\">China will lead the world in AI by 2030</a>. China has accelerated AI research and has recently <a href=\"https://www.ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NAIRR-TF-Final-Report-2023.pdf\">overtaken the U.S. in AI patent applications and AI journal citations</a>.</p>\n<p>The United States has responded with the <a href=\"https://www.ai.gov/\">National AI Initiative Act of 2020</a> to accelerate AI research and ensure U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. The U.S. reinforced this initiative with the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1260\">U.S. Innovation and Competition Act of 2021</a>. We believe pausing advanced AI research is antithetical to U.S. stated objectives. Instead, we must accelerate AI development through a coordinated effort to build trustworthy artificial intelligence.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A depiction of a futuristic cityscape where advanced AI technologies coexist harmoniously with society, made possible by collective action and responsible public policy, emphasizing the potential for accelerating AI progress without compromising safety\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5y_pmoI3NP3SDY_-9EiO0g.png\"><figcaption>Source: Midjourney V5</figcaption></figure><h3><strong><em>Accelerating AI Development</em></strong></h3>\n<p>The open letter from the Future of Life Institute may be better understood as a call to arms rather than a cease fire. With his call six years ago in <em>Life 3.0 </em>for prescient AI policy largely ignored, Max Tegmark is again calling for oversight on technology developments that will have profound implications for global geopolitics and national affairs. OpenAI — creators of ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Dall-E 2 — was <a href=\"https://openai.com/about\">founded to develop AGI</a> safely and responsibly. Current generative AI systems share Tegmark’s and OpenAI’s positive intent, yet they are subject to pernicious manipulation and there is no assurance that new AI entrants will adhere to OpenAI’s laudable mission.</p>\n<p>We share both the optimism for generative AI’s potential and concern for how it may be misused. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has called for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1641229941131051008\">coordination among firms leading AGI efforts and an effective regulatory framework</a> governing use of artificial intelligence. Altman has explained that <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond\">OpenAI’s incremental approach toward AGI</a> accelerates development with a “tight feedback loop for rapid learning and careful iteration” while giving policymakers time to see what is happening, adapt regulation, and “for people collectively to figure out what they want while the stakes are relatively low.” We agree with this approach.</p>\n<p>AGI is too important and influential to be left entirely to the private sector. Though rarely acknowledged, the U.S. has a long history of fruitful technology collaboration between the public and private sector. U.S. military leadership and the race to space has been a marriage of government initiative, funding research and private sector ingenuity. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Code-Silicon-Valley-Remaking-America-ebook/dp/B07JD1JDF9/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GX2K8G49TER7&amp;keywords=the+code+silicon+valley&amp;qid=1680312210&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+code+silicon+valley%2Cstripbooks%2C88&amp;sr=1-1\">U.S. government funded over 90% of semiconductor research</a> and development into the 1970s until volume production reduced price points to a level appropriate for commercial use. The <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330638395_DARPA_and_the_Internet_Revolution\">Internet emerged through DARPA</a> funded research during the Cold War.</p>\n<p>American innovation is a catalyst for growth and the crown jewel of our economic system. It thrives when nurtured yet has faltered when ignored. Europe surged to the lead in wireless after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM\">European Union mandated the GSM standard</a> across its countries in 1987 while U.S. firms experimented with and promoted competing standards. The U.S. today is left bereft of a local wireless network provider. The absence of standards for drone use in public airspaces during the past decade has bequeathed global leadership in drone technology to China. Our fragmentary, state-by-state policy governing of autonomous technology similarly risks yielding global market leadership.</p>\n<p>A call for an AI moratorium in the absence of clear standards risks a loss of leadership in this critical technology. Let us not repeat mistakes made in wireless technology and drones. Rather, national interests are best served by accelerating AI development with a collaborative effort that treats data as infrastructure. Coordinated efforts to build our data infrastructure should ensure data integrity, data privacy, and shared data access for appropriate purposes.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/\">OECD</a> has developed a framework describing the lifecycle and key dimensions of an AI system. Our recommendations cover the right half of the diagram, which we believe are salient at this formative stage in the development of AI.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The OECD’s framework for the classification of AI systems. In the center is “People and Planet” surrounded in clockwise order by “Data and Input”, “AI Model”, “Task and Output”, and “Application Context”\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h4k0cYi6pMTCVQUbTylHOQ.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf\">National Institute of Science &amp; Technology: Modified from OECD Framework for the Classification of AI systems</a> (2022). The two inner circles show key dimensions of the AI system, and the outer circle shows AI lifecycle stages.</figcaption></figure><h3><em>Data as Infrastructure</em></h3>\n<p>The gestalt users experience with chatbot responses reflect a synthesis of the bounty of underlying data with which they are trained on. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others oversee vast pools of data — much of it proprietary — that provide significant advantages versus aspiring startups and open-source initiatives. An omniscient AGI system could intelligently access and process all the world’s data, yet noisy, incomplete data <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04325.pdf\">limit current AI systems</a>.</p>\n<p>AI is a winner-take-most paradigm. As machine learning algorithms become more capable and pervasive, the race to AGI will be determined in large part by who has the largest data lake. Companies like OpenAI recognize this and have developed data flywheels, compounding returns by using <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-chatgpt-general-faq\">past chatbot conversations as training data</a> for models in development. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-23/microsoft-makes-multibillion-dollar-investment-in-openai\">Microsoft’s $10 billion investment</a> offers an alliance with a tech major and enhances scalability through access to Microsoft Azure.</p>\n<p>Yet no private company can match the data gathering capabilities of a nation state like China. In <em>AI Superpowers</em>, Kai-Fu Lee describes China as the ‘Saudi Arabia of Data.’ Under the <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/beijings-new-national-intelligence-law-defense-offense\">National Security Law of 2017</a>, China requires its citizens and companies to support its intelligence gathering operations. While acknowledging the United States’ superior technological expertise in the near term, Kai-Fu Lee forecasts that China will ultimately win the AI war through its superior ability to amass, centralize, and leverage data and compute resources.</p>\n<p>Data is the new infrastructure. The U.S. <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/\">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> contemplates investment in roads, airports, railways, broadband, clean energy, and clean water, yet it overlooks the most critical and strategic asset in the race to AGI. Data should be a central part of any infrastructure plan.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"An illustration of a coast-to-coast data pipeline system, connecting every region in the country, with abstract symbols representing big tech companies as the primary providers and maintainers of this national infrastructure\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tdSw_EP1VCaAw2PGrU7a6A.png\"><figcaption>Source: Midjourney V5</figcaption></figure><h3><em>Data as a Utility</em></h3>\n<p>According to White &amp; Case, a leading Washington-based law firm, “there is no single data protection legislation in the United States. Rather, a <a href=\"https://iclg.com/practice-areas/data-protection-laws-and-regulations/usa\">jumble of hundreds of laws at both the federal and state levels</a> serve to protect the personal data of U.S. residents.” Many of the governing regulations predate the Internet.</p>\n<p>Fragmentary regulation permits distributed data, which exacerbate cybersecurity threats and privacy concerns. Though the U.S. government cybersecurity budget for<a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/cybersecurity-statistics\"> is $15.6 billion</a> and U.S. companies spend over <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/cybersecurity-statistics\">$20 billion</a> for cybersecurity insurance, the federal government lacks a cohesive data strategy.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., private data has become a public resource. As Harvard professor emeritus Shoshana Zuboff described in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/opinion/facebook-privacy.html\"><em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em></a>, companies routinely troll citizens in “an economic system built on the secret extraction and manipulation of human data.” Google and Facebook hoover personal data from disparate sources and glean over $400 billion annually — $1,000 for every U.S. citizen — in advertising revenue from insights we inadvertently divulge. These companies know more about us than our most intimate friends. They may well understand us <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/24/when-facebook-knows-you-better-than-you-know-yourself/\">better than we understand ourselves</a>.</p>\n<p>As AI becomes more powerful, safeguarding privacy is more pressing. Artificial intelligence escalates the ability to extract and exploit private data. That the global <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/05/2620626/0/en/Global-Ransomware-Protection-Market-Size-Share-Revenue-Was-20-3-billion-in-2022-and-is-anticipated-to-surpass-73-9-billion-by-2030-At-a-17-5-CAGR-Emerging-Technologies-and-Strategi.html\">ransomware market is projected to grow from $20 billion</a> today to $74 billion by 2030 underscores our increasing vulnerability to nefarious actors at home and abroad.</p>\n<p>In the absence of a coherent U.S. data policy, the European Union has emerged as the global champion of data privacy with the <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) in 2018. In the past three years, <a href=\"https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/brief/data-privacy-laws-in-the-u-s/\">California, Maine, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia</a> have enacted state laws that adopt GDPR guidelines to varying degrees. While admirable, these laws add bewildering complexity and increases compliance costs for companies operating nationally and globally. The U.S. should bolster and simplify its data privacy laws with a federal policy akin to GDPR in Europe and these five states.</p>\n<p>China has taken a different, techno-utilitarian approach. The National Intelligence Law enacted in 2017 requires all organizations and citizens to support, assist and cooperate with Chinese national intelligence efforts, including companies operating abroad. Though China quietly disbarred Google and Facebook from operating in China over a decade ago, the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/bipartisan-opposition-banning-tiktok-emerges-capitol-hill-rcna77293\">U.S. has hesitated to secure private citizen’s data from Chinese companies such as TikTok</a>.</p>\n<p>Much as the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/bidens-budget-proposal-calls-for-36-billion-to-fight-climate-change.html\">White House focused on clean energy and clean water</a>, it should prioritize “clean data”.

It would improve privacy standards, empowering citizens with insights into the use of their personal data. It would also improve innovation and accelerate artificial intelligence initiatives by offering companies large and small access to a vast pool of anonymized, cleansed data — larger than any single repository of data held today.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A depiction of a virtual training ground, where Narrow AI systems act as coaches and instructors, honing the skills and abilities of a General AI, ensuring its safe and responsible development\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m2_A6VcltegGBXhvVZLjmA.png\"><figcaption>Source: Midjourney V5</figcaption></figure><h3><em>Using Narrow AI to Moderate General AI</em></h3>\n<p>To fulfill their initial intent, OpenAI and others must develop trusted AI models, which have aroused skepticism due to the unexpected, intolerant, and seemingly biased results they occasionally produce. Yet we believe that sponsors of ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Bard will more readily resolve current limitations of their minimum viable products when exposed to myriad user inputs than when sequestered in a lab under a moratorium and they are more likely to assuage public concern by coordinating efforts than searching for independent solutions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf\">AI systems are inherently socio-technical</a> in that they are influenced by societal dynamics and human behaviors. As models are trained on evolving data, output is subject to change significantly and unexpectedly affecting system functionality and trust. By employing reinforcement learning from human feedback (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback\">RLHF</a>), chatbots such as ChatGPT are inadvertently prone to codify and propagate human biases.</p>\n<p>Generative models produce media content, which suggests that regulatory standards for media companies may apply to these vendors. Yet as Section 230 demonstrates, moderating artificial intelligence is tricky as designers influence behavior but do not control the content itself. Much as a dog trainer may influence but not control a puppy, AI designers may establish guardrails but cannot fully anticipate how chatbots will behave. Human influence attenuates as technology moves from AI to AGI.</p>\n<p>Eliminating aberrant results altogether would be counterproductive. Doing so with a fully specified rules-based overlay may neuter the dynamism of an AI system. A rules-based system will never anticipate all the corner cases and will result in a pockmarked patch fixing approach characteristic of the cybersecurity industry. Top-down rules-based approaches also raise questions on who would adjudicate the bounds of acceptability. In the wrong hands, top-down approaches may appear arbitrary undermining trust in our democratic tradition. Instead, companies have a shared interest in developing standards for moderating content and should coordinate efforts.</p>\n<p>Narrow AI may be used to moderate general AI better than a rules-based approach — both in managing boundary conditions and parameter moderation to prevent manipulative distortions. Narrow AI approaches applies augmented intelligence by using human input to describe the principles that govern boundary conditions and the degree to which parameters may shift in response to classes of user inputs.</p>\n<p>Applying a black box system to govern another black box system is not a fail-safe solution as it may initially compound unexpected outcomes. Human oversight is required, but these companion AI systems will better anticipate and moderate corner cases over time, which will reduce the need for human intervention as these systems expand.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A creative portrayal of a united front formed by various stakeholders, including government, academia, industry, and civil society, as they collaborate on a national AI strategy aimed at addressing risks and accelerating AI development\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Eu6UJU7NueNj3BSeSt_GgQ.png\"><figcaption>Source: Midjourney V5</figcaption></figure><h3><strong><em>Concluding Thoughts</em></strong></h3>\n<p>Artificial intelligence is a fundamental paradigm shift that alters our common conceptions of fundamental American values. How does free speech apply to generative AI? How do we rethink privacy in a world in which data sensors have infiltrated our most intimate chambers and we leave data exhaust with every step and breath? How may artificial intelligence impact civil liberties and the uniquely American view of rugged individualism? Do large language model purveyors fall under the same output responsibility as media companies under Section 230?</p>\n<p>Data is intensely private. Yet in an AI arms race, data is also a public good. Our data as infrastructure proposal, including ‘data as a utility’, requires a higher degree of coordination, oversight, and data moderation. We believe our proposal for data as a utility can be implemented in a way that improves privacy, confidentiality, and cybersecurity. An overarching data strategy, including adoption of GDPR oriented policy, will reinforce privacy and lower the cost of doing business relative to our current fragmentary data system.</p>\n<p>The energy and telecom industries are precedents for data as a utility. While managing data has distinctive features, they may serve as a guide for best practices and pitfalls to avoid. Our proposal has distinctive features from a traditional utility model as it leverages existing data infrastructure and retains ownership by the current industry leaders. At the same time, it aggregates and manages data in a centralized way to maximize the benefits of privacy, confidentiality, cybersecurity, and AI compute capacity.</p>\n<p>Of equal importance, the data utility and narrow AI modeling proposals accelerate the development to retain AI leadership consistent with the <a href=\"https://www.ai.gov/\">National AI Initiative Act of 2020</a> objectives. We see the open letter from the Future of Life Institute as a call to arms rather than a cease fire. It is a call for collective action to raise public policy awareness of AI risks.</p>\n<p>Our ultimate national interest is to accelerate AI progress so that we may forge ahead rather than fall behind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulasel/\"><strong><em>Paul Asel</em></strong></a></p>\n<p><em>A 35-year venture capital industry veteran, Paul is the co-founder and Managing Member at </em><a href=\"https://www.ngpcap.com/\"><em>NGP Capital</em></a><em>, a global venture firm with $1.7 billion in assets under management and offices in Europe, China, and the United States.

However, job interviews are a notoriously <a href=\"https://qr.ae/prgJol\">poor predictor</a> of on-the-job performance. So, how would ChatGPT fare performing the day-to-day tasks of a tech worker? Is the software engineering profession under an imminent existential threat?</p>\n<p>As a mobile app developer, I wanted to understand ChatGPT’s ability to design and program large-scale applications. Can it piece together an entire project and transform mobile app development into an interactive, “choose your own adventure” experience? Can ChatGPT democratize app development — placing this valuable skill in the hands of the average layperson with an original idea?</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ktdsjioxQE9C90Fu3uJDDQ.png\"><figcaption>Source: Midjourney</figcaption></figure><h3>ChatGPT Codes an App</h3>\n<p>To evaluate ChatGPT’s app development skills, I decided to guide it through the development of a fully featured “Reddit client” iOS app. RedditGPT should have the ability to load a list of posts from a user-specified subreddit along with a “post details view” complete with comments and more. Throughout the challenge I assumed minimal prior coding experience and avoided writing a single line of code — every snippet of code driving the app had to be written entirely by ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>Getting ChatGPT on the right initial track turned out to be the most finicky and time-intensive aspect of the programming exercise. After dozens of iterations, I was finally able to display a simple list of Reddit posts (shown below) with the prompt “create a SwiftUI app that displays a list of the top posts from reddit.com” followed by five subsequent error-correcting prompts. Through hours of experimentation, I picked up on ChatGPT’s quirks and developed tactics to keep the conversation on course. For example, keeping code heavily abstracted, modularized, and adherent to an industry-standard application design pattern (in this case MVVM) allowed ChatGPT to focus on more narrow chunks of functionality — more similar in fashion to the chatbot’s specialty of coding interview questions.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z2713UhKVCQRL-kU-K3DUg.png\"><figcaption>An app which displays a simple list of Reddit posts written entirely by ChatGPT</figcaption></figure><p>As a seasoned iOS app developer, I found the process excruciating. However, after hundreds of prompts spread across dozens of conversations, I finally lassoed ChatGPT into building a decent, fully featured iOS app! Here is <a href=\"https://sharegpt.com/c/P9mwcVK\">my full conversation</a> with the generative AI chat bot along with the <a href=\"https://github.com/chappyasel/RedditGPT\">final project codebase</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8f02e9f0a7123e8ae95d0b26fced3bd7/href\">https://medium.com/media/8f02e9f0a7123e8ae95d0b26fced3bd7/href</a><p>Impressively, ChatGPT successfully built a complex, interactive, web-enabled iOS app with 500+ lines of functional code. It even suggested a reasonable file structure based on the code it had written. While my stretch goal was to get to 100 prompts in one continuous chat, my journey was terminated abruptly after 80 prompts when the answers became incoherent despite repeated backtracking and iteration. Nevertheless, I think that the incredibly promising capability of ChatGPT speaks for itself in the video above.</p>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<p>Grappling with ChatGPT for over 20 hours during this challenge, I was continuously amazed at just how capable the large language model (LLM) was given the absence of formal scaffolding applied around the open-ended task of writing a fully featured Reddit client iOS app. Following this experience, here are three of my takeaways as we work towards optimizing our collective use of generative AI.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*adf2gpxBiTAUjaKjthLMYA.png\"><figcaption>Source: Midjourney</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>1: Context</strong></h4>\n<p>Providing context when having ChatGPT iterate on a complex codebase such as the RedditGPT app is critical. While ChatGPT has an impressive look-back of at least <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/zt3t3q/just_what_chatgpt_can_see_back_at_least_13000/\">1,000 words</a>, it was necessary to regularly include clarifying prose and snippets of the codebase’s current state. Without this, ChatGPT often suggested code which conflicted with the rest of the project and failed to compile.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt engineering</strong> seeks to align an LLM’s goals with the user’s by attaching the full context, set of assumptions, and hints at desired outcome in the prompt. I like to think of the components of this provided context as <strong>input modules</strong>. These are both 1) supplementary inputs and 2) modifications to the user’s input that optimize for <strong>goal alignment</strong>. For example, one input module helpful for this challenge would be a list of available classes in the existing code. In fact, ChatGPT already does much of the heavy lifting for you under the hood as evidenced by explorations in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kliu128/status/1623472922374574080?s=20\">prompt injection</a>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EJy2fQFkXMYyag-X5gtVrg.png\"><figcaption>Source: Midjourney</figcaption></figure><h4>2: Hallucination</h4>\n<p>ChatGPT’s propensity to <strong>“hallucinate”</strong> convincing yet false realities is <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web\">well documented</a>. During this exercise, I repeatedly observed that ChatGPT referenced nonexistent symbols, un-imported third party libraries, or incongruous code clearly gleaned directly from an online tutorial.</p>\n<p>Hence, I found myself developing a routine wherein I would plug in the new code, attempt to compile the updated app, and either 1) prompt ChatGPT with whatever errors arose, or 2) back up a few prompts once it seemed like ChatGPT had dug itself into a hole that it could not escape. Generalizing this, the validation and post-processing of LLM output can be thought of as <strong>output modules</strong>. As described above, I played the part of a manual output validator but it is clear to see how this process can be automated. For instance, one of ChatGPT’s output modules is a content moderation filter which prevents it from producing controversial or otherwise unsavory output.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9a1UI_PQ8H5owIgEz5BAnQ.png\"><figcaption>Source: Midjourney</figcaption></figure><h4>3: Generality</h4>\n<p>Despite ChatGPT’s glaring shortcomings, the rate of progress in LLM capability and scale over the past couple of years is staggering. Looking through my full conversation with ChatGPT, it was able to do everything from generate code from scratch to debug compiler errors to suggest and implement high-level improvements to suggest a file structure for maintainability.</p>\n<p>As powerful as ChatGPT’s generality is, this comes at the cost of precision and performance in narrow, precise use cases such as app development. Applications built on top of LLMs can overcome this by <strong>fine tuning</strong> — training the model with additional domain-specific dataset to improve the quality, speed, and consistency of results. <strong>Post-training pruning</strong> is another recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00774.pdf\">topic of research</a> which promises a potential reduction in model size of 90%+ and reduced training costs.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VEAc8jAJ-Ea5m1Cqpa0I9A.png\"><figcaption>Source: Midjourney</figcaption></figure><h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>So, will ChatGPT replace software engineers outright within the next handful of years? Almost certainly not. However, LLMs will continue to augment ever larger swaths of engineering capabilities. For now, these models are better off as tools or assistants (eg. Github Copilot), leaving the critical high-level problem solving to the engineer. Much like calculators are an indispensable tool for mathematicians, LLMs will act as a force multiplier for software engineers. This symbiotic relationship between LLMs and engineers will become increasingly crucial as the scope and complexity of software continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Generative AI is a disruptive innovation that has the potential to reshape entire industries in the years to come. There is a virtually limitless range of opportunities for tailored suites of <strong>input modules</strong>, <strong>output modules</strong>, and <strong>fine tuned, pruned models</strong> to be applied to specific verticals. This is what will transform LLMs from mere shortcuts into a revolutionary new set of tools. On their own, LLMs don’t make for excellent app developers, but they can and will be transformed into one.</p>\n<p>The experiment above offers a tantalizing glimpse into a future where complete creative power is made accessible to everyone. The barriers to entry for the creator economy are crumbling as previously passive content consumers will become active contributors. These new tools will have a profound impact on the economy akin to the proliferation of personal computers.</p>\n<blockquote>One of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>~ Steve Jobs</blockquote>\n<p>Who knows — generative AI might just be the last mind bicycle that man need ever make. <em>(hint: </em><a href=\"https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/technology-ethics/resources/good-machine-nice-machine-superintelligent/\"><em>AGI</em></a><em> 😉)</em></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3tX1M_JZ3u7H65e3gG5KPQ.png\"><figcaption>Source: Midjourney</figcaption></figure><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sharegpt.com/c/P9mwcVK\">Check out this ShareGPT conversation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chappyasel/RedditGPT\">GitHub - chappyasel/RedditGPT: A Reddit client created entirely with ChatGPT</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Pro tip: you can give up to 50 claps for an article on Medium!

Preparing to perform my solo posing routine, I masked first time jitters with a composed facade after hearing judges could sense fear like sharks smell blood in the water. Performing at a bodybuilding competition almost naked in front of a mass of ogling strangers was the culmination of a five-year journey. Once terrified at the mere thought of presenting a powerpoint in front of a small class, it hit me: <em>how did I get here?</em></p>\n<p>I have been enthralled by computers and programming for as long as I can remember. Spending entire weekends squirreled away in my room, I taught myself how to write iOS applications, tinkered with Arduinos and bread board circuits, built custom computers, and reverse engineered electronic toys. Attending Thomas Jefferson, a nationally ranked magnet high school for science and technology, I identified with a peer group who shared my reclusive, geeky passions.</p>\n<p>My obsession with technology crowded out all other interests. As it became desperately clear that I needed a second hobby, I started weightlifting during my senior year of high school in an effort to stay in shape. Tentatively, I set out on a path which I hoped would lead me to break out of my comfort zone, explore my physical and mental limits, and finally develop a more well-rounded identity. Embarking on an odyssey with no destination, I knew an opportunity full of growth and exploration awaited.</p>\n<h3>Growing</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/625/1*owCF8vP9LvQ9o2J3PH7SdA.jpeg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VvKwcOcpHEwCoyE27OX_6g.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xEckM8C_Zi-Wi1OePQrSDg.png\"><figcaption>An early progress photo from 2017 along with my first basic workout plan</figcaption></figure><h4>Training</h4>\n<p>Beginning my weightlifting journey with no prior experience, my first few workouts were a simple smattering of exercises thrown together haphazardly. Without a solid game plan, initial progress was sluggish and my commitment wavered.</p>\n<p>Taking inspiration from late nights on Khan Academy teaching myself programming, I turned to YouTube for online coaching. Soaking up hours of content, I found that the videos from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/icecream4PRs\">Jeff Nippard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCadiU6WTKl65HUwEih1XLYg\">PictureFit</a> referencing hard data and scientific literature appealed to me most. Gradually, I developed a basic workout program from recommended exercises that were both achievable and effectual. I could finally see myself getting bigger and my lifts increasing. Feeling inspired, tracking this progress seemed like a natural next step.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mVyx1nb3FZg0eHBsJHB5ow.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eluTGOHZbtLw88It7Wce1g.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4Hv9OazVqKoS-PlPfGrAEA.png\"><figcaption>Tracking progression, from spreadsheet to Weightlifting App</figcaption></figure><h4>Tracking</h4>\n<p>Weightlifting’s quantitative, analytical nature provided an immediate draw for me. Since a key aspect for building muscle is the application of progressive overload — gradually adding weight to the bar over time — it seemed vital to track and analyze my workouts. Finding pen and paper cumbersome, I switched to spreadsheets for record keeping. However, I knew that my aptitude for programming could take tracking and analysis to the next level.</p>\n<p>Things immediately clicked as I built out a prototype iOS app over the weekend to log simple workouts. Inspired, I designed a system for tracking supersets and calculating total workout volume. Next, I layered analytical algorithms on top to display per-exercise progress graphs. Crucially, a mutually reinforcing amalgamation began to occur. Programming new features for my app impelled me to test them during a workout while weightlifting itself in return provided the insights and impetus for yet more new feature ideas. For the first time, I could not wait to get to the gym every day.</p>\n<p>This synergistic relationship between weightlifting and app development remains <em>the</em> key driver of my passion and perseverance. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weightlifting-app/id1266077653\">Weightlifting App</a> is now a top-ten weightlifting app in the iOS App Store with over forty thousand installs and two million total user sessions.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Two screenshots of my weight log spreadsheet: one displaying my first bulk and the other displaying an aggregate graph of my weight over the past four years\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Co7XGqpOSUJ25o_Cwe2jYg.png\"><figcaption>The weight log spreadsheet — including my first bulk and an aggregate weight graph</figcaption></figure><h4>Weight</h4>\n<p>As my strength ballooned, so did my weight. I felt stronger but still looked like the same pudgy technophile I had always been. Ready to commit to bodybuilding more holistically, I began to explore bulk/cut cycling. Gaining weight via a caloric surplus optimizes for muscle growth while losing weight via a caloric deficit paired with a proper diet disproportionately encourages fat loss. Easier said than done, I quickly came to understand that successfully bulking or cutting requires extensive organization and diligence.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the novel synergy I discovered between weightlifting and app development, my disposition for technology took over as I programmed a spreadsheet to log and analyze short- and long-term weight trends. Following months of failing to lose weight consistently, the new system suddenly made logging a breeze and my weight was finally under control.</p>\n<p>For four years now I have strategically seesawed an average of over twenty pounds per cycle. Continually utilizing and expanding functionality, the spreadsheet serves as a valuable historical record, platform for planning, and as a daily motivator to weigh in and adhere to my current bulk or cut.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Two screenshots of my nutrition spreadsheet: one displaying a quantitative breakdown of protein sources and the other displaying a breakdown of grains, vegetables, and fruits\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*y-VbEgdyNLVQsCmMHFA8_Q.png\"><figcaption>The nutrition spreadsheet — including proteins, grains, breads, vegetables, and fruits</figcaption></figure><h4>Nutrition</h4>\n<p>Prior to this past year, my entire nutritional strategy consisted of simply maximizing protein intake. However, as progress plateaued, I concluded that it was finally time to take a comprehensive approach to nutrition. As it turns out, more protein is not always better — especially if it comes at the cost of more nutritionally diverse alternatives.</p>\n<p>Turning to my quantitative roots, I designed a rich methodology for ranking protein sources according to macronutrient content, micronutrient content, cost, density, preparation time, and taste. Devising my own blended formula, I objectively scored each protein source and upgraded my grocery list. Lean ground turkey in, fatty steaks out. Extending a similar methodology to fruits, vegetables, and grains, I included glycemic index, glycemic load, fullness factor, and nutritional score into my formula. Leafy greens and whole wheats in, frozen pizzas out.</p>\n<p>Armed with spreadsheets and rankings, my diet evolved into a comprehensive effort to balance macronutrient and micronutrient consumption while minimizing intake of detriments like cholesterol, saturated fats, and sodium. Since adopting proper nutrition, workout recovery times have improved significantly and adherence to my bulk/cut cycles has been much less burdensome in day-to-day life.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A poster for INBF Battle of the Bay 2022\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mJNO-ijzsbJ3WYrsQpp28w.png\"></figure><h3>Committing</h3>\n<p>Only in retrospect did I realize the tiered nature of my commitment to weightlifting. First was a commitment to maintain general physical fitness. Next, I committed to weightlifting over other athletic pursuits. Then, I committed to high intensity weightlifting and all the intricacies that came with it as opposed to simple athletic maintenance. Now, five years into weightlifting, a new echelon of commitment loomed.</p>\n<p>For the first time, I began to consider entering a bodybuilding contest as a way to put years of growth up against an objective measuring stick. Simultaneously, I could feel my inner comfort-in-the-familiar self screaming. Up until now I had kept my passion for weightlifting to myself and in the safety of my exclusive control. Was putting myself out there really worth the risk?</p>\n<p>I reflected upon my nerdy self in high school and my foundational intent to use weightlifting as a means of expanding my comfort zone. Readying myself for my biggest <em>carpe diem</em> moment yet, I scoured the web for regional bodybuilding competitions. Stumbling upon <a href=\"https://www.worldnaturalbb.com/inbf-battle-bay/\">INBF Battle of the Bay</a> — a drug-tested show taking place the following year — I embraced the opportunity for growth, signed up, and tailored my next bulk/cut cycle accordingly. Rather than entering with the objective of winning, my intention was to test the waters and determine whether bodybuilding was a passion I wanted to commit to even further.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bCiNTqRv23qlY0vldZtXqg.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2VBUnixLBLeYUqapotC_vg.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UsKyHB_Ny5uz_NaY1je4Rg.png\"><figcaption>Show preparation — weight log, workout log, food log, peak week plan, and DEXA body scan results</figcaption></figure><h3>Preparation</h3>\n<p>Eight weeks out from the show, my commitment was faltering. I weighed a dozen pounds more than planned despite being 24 weeks into my cut. I needed a small miracle if I still wanted to compete. Reaching deep into the foundations of my passion for weightlifting, I once again turned to my roots in technology as a source of reinforcement and motivation.</p>\n<p>I reconfigured my weight log to target losing twenty more pounds in eight weeks. I downloaded a meal tracking app and allotted myself a mere 1700 calories per day — the same daily recommended intake for a 100-pound teenage girl. I updated Weightlifting App with new features to provide extra exercise analysis. Leveraging the synergy I had built between technology and weightlifting, a feeling of reinvigoration washed over me.</p>\n<p>Life lived with intensity and purpose develops a momentum of its own. Framing all my decisions within the context of contest preparation put me in maximal control of my schedule which did wonders for my productivity. I eschewed temptation by avoiding alcohol, snacking, and eating out altogether. I weighed in every morning, meticulously logged every single meal, and worked out for 45 days straight.</p>\n<p>Two weeks out from the show I took a DEXA body scan which pinned me at 7.2% body fat. To close out show preparation, I designed a meticulous “peak week” plan based on a peer reviewed analysis I found. Following this regimen to a T, I entered the weekend looking better than I ever had before. With the journey of discovering and pushing past my limits complete it was time to take the final step, overcome my fears, and put my entire self out there.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m4RrBgRU1-GQWgC3Vvf_7g.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zxnleGSo9RHyTWYEFwRKug.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oGtptebml0fYdONqfhjWUA.png\"></figure><h3>Showtime</h3>\n<p>Feelings of apprehension peaked as I arrived at the venue for 8am roll call. Despite years of learning and training, <em>I still didn’t feel like a bodybuilder</em>. My unshakable identity as a shy technology nerd felt deeply incongruous. Yet heading backstage after the debriefing, the energy was palpable. The camaraderie amongst the contestants, so different from the hyper-competitive atmosphere I had anticipated, put me at ease.</p>\n<p>I immediately felt more at home as I struck up conversations with fellow competitors. In the same way I had a cohort to share my nerdy passions with in high school, I finally found a peer group who understood what it was like to go to sleep hungry every night, to skip nights out with friends, and to drop commitments just to squeeze in another workout. Maybe, just maybe, I did belong on stage.</p>\n<p><em>Showtime</em>. As I strode on stage my adrenaline spiked and my legs started cramping as dehydration took hold. Unfazed, I held myself together and took in the moment. Here was the culmination of five years of growth, learning, and hard work. A minute felt like an eternity. As music thundered throughout the venue, I began my solo posing routine and let instinct take over. In a thrilling stroke of fortune and quick-wittedness, I nailed all 25 of the poses and transitions which I had memorized only the night before. I had done it. Walking triumphantly off stage, I finally had the confidence to grant myself ownership over a new facet of my identity. <em>I am a bodybuilder</em>.</p>\n<h3>Embracing Paradoxical Passions</h3>\n<p>Weightlifting has a way of indirectly teaching a variety of profoundly important life lessons. Building and flexing not only physical muscles but also the hypothetical willpower muscle. The value of grit, essentialism, and intense focus. Daring greatly and unapologetically presenting oneself to the world. However, the most powerful lesson learned has been in embracing seemingly paradoxical passions — harnessing my innate nerdy zeal for programming and statistics as a key to unlocking success in my newer passion for weightlifting.</p>\n<p>Marc Andreessen’s <a href=\"https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html\"><em>Guide to Career Planning</em></a> introduces the notion of “[seeking] to be a double/triple/quadruple threat.” Rather than striving to be the best at one specific thing, it is both more effective and efficient to become very good (say, top quartile) at a composite set of skills. The less these skills overlap, the more unique your identity and skillset becomes.</p>\n<p>Driving this home, David Epstein’s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484\"><em>Range</em></a> contrasts “T-shaped” individuals — those with a broad range of interests and experiences — to “I-shaped” individuals who are deeply specialized in a single domain. As the internet and communication technology makes it easier than ever to leap straight to the cutting edge, it is the unique “T-shaped” individuals that can bridge troughs of knowledge who are set to thrive, uncovering the most uncommon and innovative insights that will truly change the world.</p>\n<blockquote>“Big innovation most often happens when an outsider who may be far away from the surface of the problem reframes the problem in a way that unlocks the solution.”</blockquote>\n<p>Embracing paradoxical passions leads to the formation of the most profoundly unique identities. I will likely never become the most prolific programmer or most successful bodybuilder but combining the two may lead to a more distinctive outcome than optimizing for one singular skill. Embracing their synergies and novel co-reinforcing nature allows for a special form of broad, holistic growth.</p>\n<h3>The Future</h3>\n<p>After accruing years of learning and growth just to get here, I viewed the competition as merely another step in my bodybuilding journey and carried modest expectations of success. To my immense surprise and joy, I placed second in the Men’s Novice Bodybuilding category. After the show I received astonishingly positive feedback from the head judge. If I commit fully to bodybuilding by getting a coach, practicing my stage presence, and conditioning my legs, he thinks I can compete for a pro card and qualify for the annual WNBF World Championships in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>While I certainly have my work cut out for me, my motivational flame burns more intensely than ever. When I started this journey as a shy nerd boy back in high school, stepping on a bodybuilding stage was not even within the realm of possibility. Now, five years into this odyssey of self-exploration and growth across all of life’s facets, I welcome with open arms the challenge of upping my commitment and competing for a pro card.</p>\n<p>Weightlifting has been a channel by which I have expanded my comfort zone beyond the inherently lonesome craft of programming, explored my physical and mental limits, and consequently developed a more well-rounded identity. As I see it, the skills I built and lessons learned while weightlifting carry a broad applicability to life. Fostering willpower, practicing the art of essentialism, daring greatly, and embracing my paradoxical passions form a unique foundation for growth as I venture onwards and upwards with insatiable ambition.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hLYZTVYjnDLKV5YX992uDg.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OkKUcBPuYQRJKEwjRWMSiw.png\"></figure><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CjPDS7wL_eS/\">Chappy And Tchan on Instagram: \"INBF Battle of the Bay was an absolute blast! 🌁 Since this was my first competition and I wasn't sure what my frame is best suited for, I decided to compete in both the bodybuilding and physique categories - the only crossover athlete at the show. Here are the results! - Men's Novice Bodybuilding: 2nd 🥈 - Men's Novice Physique Tall: 3rd 🥉 The results may not have been what I had hoped or anticipated but it made for an incredible learning experience. Performing up in front of hundreds of spectators after months of work was genuinely a dream come true! I made so many new I chatted with the head judge after the show and received overwhelmingly positive feedback. He said that once I figure out my poses and catch my legs with the rest of my physique I could easily get my pro card and qualify for the WNBF world championships in Las Vegas! According to him, I have incredible bodybuilding genetics and could really be competitive on the world stage. I was clearly the biggest guy there so if I take it seriously, get a coach etc. it sounds like I have a good shot of being a top US natural bodybuilder!! I've definitely got my work cut out for me but am now more motivated than ever. Next, I'll be shooting to get my pro card at the INBF Muscle Mayhem event in Sacramento next July.
